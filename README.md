# Payment Gateway Helper

The Test Card Payments Chrome Extension is a useful tool designed to simplify the testing process for payment gateways by providing a dropdown menu with test credit card numbers and their corresponding card brands. With just a few clicks, you can easily copy the test card number to your clipboard and use it for testing purposes.
